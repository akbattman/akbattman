 Ooooh ðŸ¥š easter egg ðŸ¥š Yummy. Gief Moar Plos
 
 ðŸ‘‹ Howdy. I'm Aaron Battman.

  After a few too many years of avoiding office space I have plunged back into the IT ðŸ’» world, kicking off with an intensive (to say the least ðŸ‘€), 9 week coding bootcamp with Le Wagon London and oh my days.., ðŸ¤¯ what an experience ðŸ¥³ .  MASSIVE TYS to everyone there XX
 
  Although primarily through the camp we have learnt Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, PostgreSQL, HTML, SCSS and JavaScript (forgetting to mention a few more tbh), I now just want more.., NEEEED more.

  Currently working on a reboot of the camp exercises and a week long intro to react, redux, and rails integration.
